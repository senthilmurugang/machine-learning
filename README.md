# machine-learning
This is learn machine learning by teaching a machine to learn. It uses Python(3.6.3) and Tensorflow(1.4.0) to generate machine learning models.

This project uses Anaconda(5.0.1) for isolating machine learning packages from other python packages in a virtual environment.

Create an environment named tensorflow and install tensorflow package using native python package manager.

Link to download Python 3.6.3: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363

Link to download Anaconda 5.0.1: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

Steps to install tensor flow:
-   Download and install Anaconda(add anaconda to environment path for access from command line)
-   Use "conda create -n tensorflow python=3.6 anaconda" to create a virtual environment
-   Navigate to the project folder and use "activate tensorflow" to activate the virtual environment
-   You are done, Happy learning.
